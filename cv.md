## Summary:
I became interested in web development in 2016 and decided to try my hand at courses at the Educational Center of High Technologies Park while studying HTML and CSS. And in 2018 I began to study JavaScript and English intensively. Currently I am studying JavaScript in The Rolling Scopes School with the aim of improving skills and further employment. I am sure that in 2-3 years I can claim the position of middle developer.
